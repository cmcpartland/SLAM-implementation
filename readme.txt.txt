The project code is completely written in Python. To interact with V-rep, the remoteAPI must be correctly copied over to the local Python install directory.

Everything else needed to run the code is included in the zipped folder. Only basic libraries are imported (numpy, matplotlib, time).

There are two test environments and both are equally applicable to the project.

The console only outputs messages for when landmarks are added to or removed from the database.
